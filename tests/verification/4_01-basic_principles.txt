what are the basic principles of the model?
will the model provide insights on these principles?
does the model use new/ pre-developed theory for agent traits from which the system dynamics emerge?

The basic principle of this model is natural selection.

The model is based off existing studies on how the bacteria population can gain a resistance
to antibiotics. This model is meant to provide insight on how bacteria gain a resistance and
how they respond to different applications of antibiotics
