What are the entities, what their state variables (attributes) ?
* Silver Nanoparticles
  - Color
      Blue
  - Oxygen Level
      This is for the oxidation process for the Silver Nanoparticles to release silver ions.

* Silver Ions
  - Color
      White
  - Health Points
      This determines if the bacteria has succesfully eaten the specific ion if the health points is depleted to 0.

* Bacteria Bodies (E. Coli)
  - Color
      Red for Normal Bacteria. Green for Zombie Bacteria
  - Size Level
      Bacteria will grow if they succesfully eat silver ions, this will be contained within levels 1-3 as bacteria only have a limited size that they mature to.
  - Health Points
      This determines if the bacteria has already been turned to a "Zombie" if the health points is depleted to 0. A bacteria agent can only attack one silver ion at a time but any bacteria agent can be attacked by several silver ions.

What are the scales used (ie temporal resolution, spatial resolution and bounds)?
