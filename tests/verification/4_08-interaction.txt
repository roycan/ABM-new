The Nanoparticles are the carriers of the silver ions and depending on the amount of oxygen they have, oxidation will occur, thus releasing silver ions. These silver ions will be the ones that will make the surrounding bacteria agents into zombies and will cause a wipeout. Bacteria can eat silver ions though, so if the multitude of silver ions are not enough they will be eaten by the bacteria and will cause the bacteria to grow (which only has a limited amount of growth).
