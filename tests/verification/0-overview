Have you ever wondered how a sperm cell ever reaches the egg cell? What mechanics and what rules does it follow for it to reach the egg cell? Basically what it does is it checks where heat is eminating from because the more higher the temperature the more likely there is an egg to appear. Surely there are other mechanics yet to be explored but the model describes the above description using agent-based modelling.
