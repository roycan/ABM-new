what are the basic principles of the model?
will the model provide insights on these principles?
does the model use new/ pre-developed theory for agent traits from which the system dynamics emerge?


Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is the capacity of mocrobes to resist the effects of some substance
to which they were initially sensitive, and to which may have been initially effective in suppressing it,
as in the case of some microbial infection. A specific example of such which is simulated in this model
is antibiotic resistance, though all classes of microbes may develop resistance (ie. fungi develop resistance
to antifungal substances, viruses to antiviral substances, etc.)

This resistance is essentially an expression of the phenomenon of natural selection,
wherein agentswith behavior conducive to survival thrive, while those without such behavior eventually die out.
Thus while those sensitive to antimicrobial agents die out (behavior inconducive to survival),
microbes with antiimicrobial resistance eventually thrive (behavior conducive to survival.)

The model is based off the Kishony Microbial Evolution and Growth Arena (MEGA) plate model,
which simulated how a microbial population (in this case, bacteria population) to antibiotics.
This model is meant to provide insight on how bacteria gain a resistance
and how they respond to different applications of antibiotics
