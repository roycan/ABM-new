if agents adapt, does the adaptation consider past states in the form of learning?

Individual agents do not change over time. However, like in nature, the offspring
of the bacteria may be more fit for the environment and may have more success.
As a result of this, the individual does not change, but the population as a whole
adapts to the environment through mutation and natural selection.
