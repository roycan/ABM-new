The purpose of this model is to dynamically simulate the spatiotemporal microbal evolution of antibiotic landscapes using the Kishony Model, using agent based modelling methods. This allows us to observe the general behavior of microbes in various antibiotic landscape setups. The dynamic manipulation of these setups enables us to quickly and dynamically manipulate the selected variables of each setup, which might otherwise be more materially and temporally costly to simulate and examine with actual bacteria.
