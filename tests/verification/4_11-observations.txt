what data are collected for testing and analysis?

The main data to be collected is how long it takes for the bacteria to 
develop a resistance to a certain antibiotic. The patches are divided into
several sections, each with different amounts of a certain antibiotic to mimic
the experiment "The Evolution of Bacteria on a “Mega-Plate” Petri Dish (Kishony Lab)".

It is also important to observe how the bacteria population will react to different methods
of giving antibiotics such as repeated dosages of varying strength, inconsistent dosage timing
cycling different antibiotics or just using a certain kind. This is to see what methods are
effective or harmful when it comes to the use of antibiotics as certain methods are done to
minimize the effects of resistance development.
