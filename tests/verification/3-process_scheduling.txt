Who did what and in what order?  Use pseudo-code.

Time is modeled discretely 
bacteria moves to an empty adjacent tile, checks if it replicates and checks if it dies to the antibiotic it is standing over is toxic to it

only the bacteria is moving here.

at each move the lifespan is decreased by 1.
when it replicates, there is a chance for a mutation which can change the resistance
when bacteria are beside each other then can also share resistance genes
