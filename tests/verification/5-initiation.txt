initial states? which are constant, which are varying?

The initial state of the world at time t = 0 is a certain number of bacteria
are generated and randomly placed on the map. Each patch also has a certain
level of antibiotics, with the most in the middle and decreasing to none at the edges.

The number of bacteria is ddetermined by a slider. All bacteria initially 
started with a set lifespan and no resistances at all to any kind of
bacteria. As a result of this the initialization tends to be similar with
the major difference being the placement of the bacteria. Most of these
are chosen arbitrarily except for the antibiotics which is based off
an experiment, "The Evolution of Bacteria on a “Mega-Plate” Petri Dish (Kishony Lab)"
with a similar setup. 

A youtube vide of the experiment can be found here.
