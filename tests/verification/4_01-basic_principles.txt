As ransomware is relatively new type of malware, this model uses predeveloped theories of spread of malwares on a network. However,  
there are some traits which are unique to ransomware so this model also uses details or theories concerning ransomware.

The model will provide a basic insight on the following principles:

(1) The basic principle of the model is that ransomware/malware from a computer can spread on other computers linked to
it. To this date, most operating systems that are largely affected by ransomware are those with Windows operating
system, however, Linux and MacOS may also be infected if files from Windows are stored there. There is also a greater
spread of ransomware when a computer is used on an administrative level and can infect.
 
(2) Another basic principle is that computers/files affected by ransomware could be recovered through paying or a patch.
The computer can become resistant to ransomware through securing and protecting the machine.
