The entities in this model are

1. The bacteria
The bacteria are agents with 4 state variables each. 
- lifespan attribute: represents how many ticks will the bacteria live. 
When this reaches 0, the bacteria will die, represent the ageing process
- resistance attribute: this represents the bacteriaâ€™s chance of surviving 
when exposed to antibiotics (patches)

2. The antibiotics
The antibiotics are represented by patches. Each patch can have a kind of antibiotic
and the amount of antibiotics in it which will affect it's effectiveness in killing off bacteria
