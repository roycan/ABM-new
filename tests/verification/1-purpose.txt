The purpose of this model is to model the Silver Nitrate "Aggressive Zombie" Effect by simulating it using agents. This might help out the medical research on this phenomenon greatly and if successful observations are made might benefit bacteriology and advanced medical procedures with the influence of nanotechnology. The "Zombie Effect" in eliminating bacteria is a very beneficial concept on these fields as it uses no additional resources to proliferate, it takes advantage of the victims, which in this case are the bacteria agents.
