what processes are modelled as random?

The initial positioning of bacteria is random. Along with this, 
the reproduction happens randomly, with the chance being
set by a slider. This is to abstract and simulate the growth
of bacteria. The growth rate is still exponential similar to
observed bacterial growth in real life experiments.

Another important process with random factors is the mutation.
Whenever a child is born, there is a chance for a mutation
to simulate how mutations work whenever bacteria divide.
The mutation can be a resistance to any of the antibiotics in order
to model how the bacteria population gain a resistance 
to antibiotics.
