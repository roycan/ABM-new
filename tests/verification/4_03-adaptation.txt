what, if any, rules vary decision making for agents in response to changes in themselves, others or the environment?

On the individual level, there is none. However the population as a whole changes to be more fit for the 
environment through the mutations in the offspring. The offspring that survive will reproduce more, so
the population as a whole resists the antibiotics better.
