what model state variables are informing agents' decisions?
Silver nanoparticles are basically immobile they are just scattered around the environment but silver ions are able to move and sense bacteria agents using a greedy approach. This could be a point of improvement for the version 2 of this model but we decided to stick with a manhattan distance type of appraoch as this is more intuitive and there is still a lack of research behind this.
