There is no direct interaction between bacteria. However they
do have an indirect competition between each other since there
is a limited amount of space. Bacteria that can reproduce fast
or survive the environment have a better chance of thriving
and multiplying instead of other competition.

Bacteria and antibiotics interact directly as antibiotics
harm or kill the bacteria but these can develop resistances
or even immunities in order to survive.
