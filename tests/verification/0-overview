Ransomware is a quickly developing and emerging security threat in information technology. It is a type of malicious
malware which either locks the computer or encrypts the files of affected users. In order to gain access again 
to computer or file, the victim must follow the instructions provided  in paying the ransom, quite commonly through
cryptocurrency such as Bitcoins. Some attacks, however, are just types of scareware wherein files are not really
encrypted but it just claims that the machine.
Ransomware is spread through downloading a file which carries a Trojan in which it enters the system to 
take advantage of the vulnerability of the network. To this date, some of the recent infamous ransomware breakouts
are caused by Cryptowall, WannaCry, Petya, etc.
