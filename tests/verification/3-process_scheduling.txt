Who did what and in what order?  Use pseudo-code.
Sperm cells spawn in designated spot
Egg cell spawns in designated spot
The spot where an egg cell is spawned is planted with a high temperature
Diffuse the heat either through stochastic or deterministic diffusion
Color patches accordingly
If go is pressed, sperm cells wiggle towards patches with higher temperature.
If a sperm cell touches an egg cell, die.
If all sperm cells die, stop the program.
