what are the basic principles of the model?

  Based on the data from real companies, we can make a fictional company and let its stocks behave in this way over time. 

  We can get variables, observe their relationship with the stock price of a company over time. And from this data, our model tries
  to predict the behavior of the stock price over time as the user changes the values of the variables.


will the model provide insights on these principles?


does the model use new/ pre-developed theory for agent traits from which the system dynamics emerge?
  No
