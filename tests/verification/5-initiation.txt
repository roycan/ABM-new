initial states? which are constant, which are varying?
  initially, neutral lang lahat
  tapos bibigyan sila ng set of friends
  then isa sa kanila magiging fake news spreader
  then bibigyan ng bias (random) yung mga neutrals either towards or against the fake news
  then neutrals will turn to believers or strongholds or stay neutral
  decision based on how many of their friends believe or condemn the news and their initial bias
