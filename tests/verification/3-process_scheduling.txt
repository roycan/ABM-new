The following are the processes used in the model:
(1) Set up
	Set up computer
	Link computers
	Set  computers that are initially infected randomly

(2) Set up computers
	Set location of computers in the environment
	Set status
	Set operating system
	Set control to computer

(3) Link computers
	Link computers according to type of network	

(4) Go
	While all computers not infected:
		Spread malware
		Check status (infected or recover)

(5) Spread malware
	If linked computer is not resistant:
		If malware spread chance is greater than some value:
			Computer is infected

(6) Check status
	If infected:
		If recovery chance is greater than some value:
			If resistance chance is greater than some value:
				Computer becomes resistant
			Else:
				Computer can be infected again
		Else:
			Computer is still infected

Time is modeled in a continuous processes. The variables are updated asynchronously, meaning the entities may 
change the value of their state variables not simultaneously or as the process is calculated and not waiting for
other entities.
