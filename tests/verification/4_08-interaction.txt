The Silver Nanoparticles are the carriers of the silver ions and if they collide with sugar molecules, oxidation will occur, thus releasing charged silver ions (cations). These silver ions, if collided with a bacteria unit, will inflict damage to it and if the total health of a bacteria unit reaches 0, will convert it to a "zombie" unit.
