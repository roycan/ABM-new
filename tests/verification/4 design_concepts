Basic principles
- The model uses the concepts of social networks and manipulating edges in the
graph. The concept of using strategies and some factor of randomness is also 
explored.
- The model will provide insights on how many people end up being matched.

Objective
- The objective of each person is to be matched to a person with whom they share
a common liking or interest with.

Sensing
- In the future, an extension involving taking into account the person's
physical distance to his/her match may be implemented.

Interaction
- Each person will either swipe right (accept the match) or swipe left (reject
the match). This will affect who gets to be matched with whom at the end.

Stochasticity
- The generation of the population and initial matches is mostly random. A
strategy involving randomness can also be included.
