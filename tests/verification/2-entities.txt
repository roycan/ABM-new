What are the entities, what their state variables (attributes) ?

Silver Nanoparticles
  Color : Blue
  Shape : Filled Circle
  Parameter :  num-of-silver-nanoparticles - determines the number of silver particles on the board.

Sugar Molecules
  Color : Blue
  Shape : Hollow Circle
  Parameter :  num-of-sugar-molecules - determines the number of silver particles on the board.

Silver Ions
  Color : White
  Shape : Small Filled Circle
  Owns : health-points - counter to make ions deteriorate over time to simulate loss of charge.

Bacteria Units (Pseudomonas aeruginosa)
  Color (alive) : pink
  Color (zombie) : green, blinks red when releasing an ion.
  Shape : Pill-shaped
  Owns : health-points - counter to make bacteria have a sense of resistance to a number of silver ions before becoming into a zombie.

What are the scales used (ie temporal resolution, spatial resolution and bounds)?
