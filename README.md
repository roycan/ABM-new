# [An Agent-based Model that Simulates the “Aggressive Zombie” Effect (Specific: Silver Nitrate Bacteria Cleansing Effect)](http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2015/05/silver-turns-bacteria-deadly-zombies)

Direct Reference: Wakshlak, Racheli Ben-Knaz, Rami Pedahzur, and David Avnir. "Antibacterial activity of silver-killed bacteria: the" zombies" effect." Scientific reports 5 (2015).

## General Facts:
* Silver ions kill the bacteria, not silver nanoparticles.
* Silver ions only get released from the particles when there is oxidation.
* Oxidization of silver nanoparticles lead to the release of cations due to the removal of electrons.
* It was suggested that reductive enzymes and reducing sugar molecules serve as reducing agents for such incorporated metal cations

## Model Assumptions:
* Assume a level of measure for the area of effect. Project 15 µg/L to a number of silver ions for it to become agents (microscopically). 
* Silver nanoparticles should have an oxygen variable that will determine if they will release silver ions.
* Bacteria agents should be able to get big if successfully eaten silver ions (and has max size), suggestion health-based system like in a game. (might get complicated due to the needed health regeneration and game theory involved)
* Three agent sets involved: bacteria, silver nanoparticles, and silver cations.
* Colors:
	a) Normal Bacteria -> Pink (for E. Coli)
	b) Zombie Bacteria -> Green
	c) Silver Nanoparticles -> Blue
	d) Silver Ions -> White

## Silver-nanoparticle Facts:
* One silver nanoparticle is about 5-10nm in size.


## Pseudomonas aeruginosa Facts:
* When they exposed living bacteria to the dead (zombie bacteria infected with silver ions), they witnessed a microscopic massacre: Up to 99.99% of the living bacteria met their doom.
* This is bigger than the silver nanoparticles. (difference of super rough estimation of 10^-3 size)
* It is a rod about 1-5 µm long and 0.5-1.0 µm wide. (ref: https://microbewiki.kenyon.edu/index.php/Pseudomonas_aeruginosa)
